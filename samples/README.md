# Azure Relay samples

This folder contains samples that demonstrate the features of Azure Relay. See
the readme files within each sample folder for details. The following feature
areas are covered:

## Hybrid Connections

The [hybrid-connections](./hybrid-connections) folder contains samples that
demonstrate the WebSocket and HTTP features of the open-protocol Hybrid
Connections feature set.

There are [.NET](hybrid-connections/dotnet/README.md), [Node.js](hybrid-connections/node/README.md), 
and [Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-relay-java) samples, with further languages
forthcoming.

## WCF Relay

The [wcf-relay](./wcf-relay) folder contains a set of samples that demonstrate
the features of the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) Relay. The
[readme.md file](wcf-relay/README.md) within the WCF Relay explains how to
build and run the samples. The WCF Relay features are only available for
the full .NET Framework on Windows, which they depend on.
